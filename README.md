Can be used as a complete alternative to a physical mouse and keyboard!

<!-- Maybe add audio tool that runs specific program so the program isn't always on. e.g. for volume control, user would say "turn on volume control" to run the program
  Would be super sick if you used arduino for all this shit too.

## Demo

Note that the GUI window in the top right is used mainly for demonstration purposes and can be minimized without any changes in functionality.

## Usage

**Power Button**

To toggle the controller on and off users can hover their index finger over the power button in the top right corner of the capture video. The toggle makes a sound so it can be used even when the capture video window is minimized by just moving the hand in top right corner direction until the sound is played. This feature helps prevent users from unintentionally triggering actions with the controller.
